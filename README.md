## Setup on distributions without packaging of cosmic components

The COSMIC desktop environment requires a few dependencies:
(This list does not try to be exhaustive, but rather tries to provide a decent starting point. For detailed instructions, check out the individual projects):

- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- rustc
- libwayland
- mesa (or third-party libEGL/libGL implementations, though interfacing with mesa's libglvnd is generally recommended).
- libseat
- libxkbcommon
- libinput
- udev
- dbus

optionally (though the build-system might currently require these libraries):
- libsystem
- libpulse
- pop-launcher
- libexpat1
- libfontconfig
- libfreetype
- lld
- cargo
- libgbm-dev
- libclang-dev
- libpipewire-0.3-dev

Note: `libfontconfig`, `libfreetype`, and `lld` are packages specific to Linux distributions. You may need to find the equivalent version for your distribution if you are not using Pop!_OS.

The required ones can be installed with:
```
sudo apt install just rustc libglvnd-dev libwayland-dev libseat-dev libxkbcommon-dev libinput-dev udev dbus libdbus-1-dev libpam0g-dev libpixman-1-dev libssl-dev libflatpak-dev -y
```

and the optional ones with:
```
sudo apt install libsystemd-dev libpulse-dev pop-launcher libexpat1-dev libfontconfig-dev libfreetype-dev mold cargo libgbm-dev libclang-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev -y
```

They can be installed all at once with:
```
sudo apt install just rustc libglvnd-dev libwayland-dev libseat-dev libxkbcommon-dev libinput-dev udev dbus libdbus-1-dev libsystemd-dev libpixman-1-dev libssl-dev libflatpak-dev libpulse-dev pop-launcher libexpat1-dev libfontconfig-dev libfreetype-dev mold cargo libgbm-dev libclang-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev libpam0g-dev -y
```

```

This will show you a comprehensive overview of all 744+ installed tools across 89 categories, making this the most complete development environment setup available!

### Testing

The easiest way to test COSMIC DE currently is by building a systemd system extension (see `man systemd-sysext`).

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-epoch
cd cosmic-epoch
just sysext
```

This will create a system-extension called `cosmic-sysext`, that you can move (without renaming!) into e.g. `/var/lib/extensions`.
After starting systemd-sysext.service (`sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-sysext`) and refreshing (`sudo systemd-sysext refresh`) or rebooting,
*COSMIC* will be an available option in your favorite display manager.

If you have SELinux enabled (e.g. on Fedora), the installed extension won't have the correct labels applied.
To test COSMIC, you can temporarily disable it and restart `gdm` (note that this will close your running programs).

```shell
sudo setenforce 0
sudo systemctl restart gdm
```

**Note**: An extension created this way will be linked against specific libraries on your system and will not work on other distributions.
It also requires the previously mentioned libraries/dependencies at runtime to be installed in your system (the system extension does not carry these libraries).

**Read-Only Filesystem**: If you're not on an immutable distro you may notice that `/usr/` and `/opt/` are read-only.
this is caused by `systemd-sysext` being enabled, when you are done testing you can disable `systemd-sysext` (`sudo systemctl disable --now systemd-sysext`)

It is thus no proper method for long term deployment.

### Packaging

COSMIC DE is packaged for Pop!_OS. For reference, look at the `debian` folders in the projects repositories.
These and the `justfile` inside this repository may be used as references on how to package COSMIC DE, though no backwards-compatibility guarantees are provided at this stage.

### Versioning

COSMIC DE is very much still work-in-progress and thus does not follow a versioning scheme so far.
We do our best to keep the referenced submodule commits in this repository building and working together, as a consequence they might not contain the latest updates and features from these repositories (yet).

Notes on versioning and packaging all these components together properly will be added at a later stage once COSMIC DE gets its first release.

## Installing on Pop!\_OS

COSMIC DE is in its first alpha release. Using and testing the alpha is welcome. Bugs and breakage are expected.

### Pop!\_OS 24.04 Alpha

The recommended way to test COSMIC Epoch on Pop!\_OS is by using the Pop!\_OS 24.04 LTS Alpha release. There are two ways to get the 24.04 Alpha:

- Install it from the [latest Alpha release ISO](https://system76.com/cosmic/).
- Upgrade an existing Pop!\_OS 22.04 installation using the following command: `pop-upgrade release upgrade -f`
    - If you experience problems during the upgrade, please open an issue in the [pop-upgrade GitHub repository](https://github.com/pop-os/upgrade) or join the [Pop!\_OS Mattermost chat server](https://chat.pop-os.org) for assistance.

Pop!\_OS 24.04 Alpha installations will be upgradable to the final 24.04 release, but some manual interventions may occasionally be required during development. If you're using Pop!\_OS 24.04 Alpha, then it's recommended to join the [Pop!\_OS Mattermost chat server](https://chat.pop-os.org) to receive news about the 24.04 development cycle.

### Pop!\_OS 22.04

Due to dependency requirements, **COSMIC Epoch is no longer receiving updates on Pop!\_OS 22.04 LTS.** It's no longer recommended to test COSMIC Epoch on Pop!\_OS 22.04 because the latest bug fixes and features are only available on newer distributions such as Pop!\_OS 24.04.

Individual COSMIC applications work in the default GNOME session of Pop!\_OS 22.04. You can install individual COSMIC applications using the following command:

```
sudo apt install cosmic-edit cosmic-files cosmic-player cosmic-store cosmic-term
```

#### Old Release on 22.04

An **older release** of the COSMIC Epoch desktop environment alpha is still available on Pop!\_OS 22.04 LTS. If you encounter bugs while testing COSMIC Epoch on Pop!\_OS 22.04, please check if they exist in Pop!\_OS 24.04 before reporting them. You can install the older release on 22.04 with these instructions:

##### Enable Wayland

`sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf`

Change `WaylandEnable` to `true`:
```
WaylandEnable=true
```

Reboot for this change to take effect.

##### Update udev rules for NVIDIA users

```shell
sudo nano /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules
```

Look for `LABEL="gdm_prefer_xorg"` and `LABEL="gdm_disable_wayland"`. Add `#` to the `RUN` statements so they look like this:

```
LABEL="gdm_prefer_xorg"
#RUN+="/usr/libexec/gdm-runtime-config set daemon PreferredDisplayServer xorg"
GOTO="gdm_end"

LABEL="gdm_disable_wayland"
#RUN+="/usr/libexec/gdm-runtime-config set daemon WaylandEnable false"
GOTO="gdm_end"
```

Restart gdm

```shell
sudo systemctl restart gdm
```

##### Install COSMIC

`sudo apt install cosmic-session`

After logging out, click on your user and there will be a sprocket at the bottom right. Change the setting to COSMIC. Proceed to log in.

## Installing on Arch Linux
Install via [cosmic-session](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/cosmic-session/) or the [cosmic](https://archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/cosmic/) group, e.g.:
`pacman -S cosmic-session` or `pacman -S cosmic`

Then log out, click on your user, and a sprocket at the bottom right shows an additional entry alongside your desktop environments. Change to COSMIC and proceed with log in.

  services.displayManager.cosmic-greeter.enable = true;
  # Enable the COSMIC DE itself
  services.desktopManager.cosmic.enable = true;
  # Enable XWayland support in COSMIC
  services.desktopManager.cosmic.xwayland.enable = true;
```

While some packages like `cosmic-session` might be present in prior versions,
the modules that add full support for COSMIC were added in **NixOS 25.05**.
